The goal of this project was to create a game which lets you practice different, all very basic, mathematical skills, without forcing you to do so at any point in the game.
The purpose of it was to find ways to incentivize users to actively train the skills they'd need to survive math class, without having to muster any, or at least not much, willpower to do so. This project in itself was way too small to implement training sets for all of these skills on its own though. The goal of it was to explore possibilities, not to deliver a fully fledged system.
It is dedicated to those who do dislike homework, but still want to improve (in a less frustrating way).

Gameplay-wise the game is strongly inspired by the wonderful SteamBirds.

The result, an app called MathBirds, is available on Android through the Play Store. The APK is also available [right here](https://github.com/PSteinhaus/CocosSharpMathGame/releases/tag/v.1.043) on GitHub.
